	cat filename
	- read from multiple files
	cat file1 file2 
	- write into files

Input/Output redirection
------------------------

cat file1 > outfile

read the contents from file1 and write into outfile

If outfile is not present already, it will be newly created. 
If it is already present, and has some content, it will be overwritten

cat >> outfile

>> is used to append to previously present content of the file

touch command - 

touch file1 file2 
1. create empty files
2. modifies the last mtime of file without making changes to the content of the file


ls -l 
mtime - changes to the content of file
atime - read the content of file
ctime - change in meta data of the file
btime - time of creation
